<h2>
HCI (Oculus VR Headset)
</h2>



<p>
	For Lab 3 , I deployed the Roll- A -Maze game that we created in Lab 1 , on an Oculus headset. In this case, we designed our own XR Hand Controller to the replace the standard Input.

	A virtual reality headset is a head-mounted device that provides virtual reality for the wearer. These headsets  include a stereoscopic display (providing separate images for each eye), stereo sound, and sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes for tracking the pose of the user's head to match the orientation of the virtual camera with the user's eye positions in the real world. In this project I used the Oculus Quest.

	Once, the user puts on the Oculus headset, he / she is immersed into the game. The ball can be moved by the Oculus controllers. In the video walkthrough you can see the ball moving. The collectables have now the property of being grabbed.
	
	I also displayed teleporting through the walls, which mostly functions as it should, but sometimes can be buggy and causes the maze to topple.
