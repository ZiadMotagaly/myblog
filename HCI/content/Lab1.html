HCI (PC)
</h2>

<p>
	In this Lab, I designed a game called Roll- A -Maze , where the user neads to 
	control the ball using Keyboard Inputs , to navigate through the maze and collect 
	points to win the game. 
	
	The arrow keys move the ball in their respective directions, and the space key 
	makes the ball jump.

<p>

	The User needs to collect the green cubes to increment the counter by 1.
	However it is not that easy. The orange cubes deduce the count by 1.
	Some of the cubes are set higher than the ball, so the user needs to 
	jump. However, the bounciness of the ball is set to make it challenging for 
	the user to control the ball while jumping, leading him/her to make mistakes.

<p>
	Scripts are the main driver of the game. There are scripts to control the ball, the rotation of the collectibles, and even the camera movement to follow the ball through the maze.
	</p>
	
	<p>To win the game you need to collect all 5 green collectibles.
	
	The following video shows a walkthrough of winning Roll- A -Maze.
