<p>
	In this Lab, I deployed the Roll- A -Maze game that we created in Lab 1 , on an Android smartphone. This is done through Unity as well, by modifying the Build and Player settings.
	
	The main difference is that our input will now be set to the controls embedded in modern smart phones. 
	I implemented both a Gyroscope and an Acceloremeter into the Input settings of the ball.

<p>

	<strong> Gyroscope </strong> :senses change in orientation of a device, and when paired with an accelerometer, is an excellent tool for measuring the orientation of an object in 3D space. Gyroscopes determine angular velocity (Ï‰) typically measured in radians/second.

<p>

	<strong> Accelerometer </strong> : senses the vibration, or acceleration of motion of a structure. The force caused by vibration or a change in motion (acceleration) causes the mass to "squeeze" the piezoelectric material which produces an electrical charge that is proportional to the force exerted upon it. Since the charge is proportional to the force, and the mass is a constant, then the charge is also proportional to the acceleration.

	A challenge here was to implement the jump function of the game. (Other than tapping on the screen which was the most natural way of making the ball jump) 
	
	I tried using an acceloremeter threshold, where if the ball is getting faster , it would at some point jump. However , it did not suit this game. The Playboard is too small, for it to function properly.
